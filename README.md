# @mjackson/react-style

This project combines [Pete's component-based approach to styling documents in jsxstyle](https://github.com/petehunt/jsxstyle) and puts it on top of [Sunil's react-css library](https://github.com/threepointone/react-css).

Just an experiment for now, but I think this could work...

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save @mjackson/react-style
